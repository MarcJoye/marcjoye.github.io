  <p>The ACM Workshop on Digital Rights Management is an international
  forum that serves as an interdisplinary bridge between areas that
  can be applied to solving the problem of Intellectual Property
  protection of digital content.  These include: cryptography,
  software and computer systems design, trusted computing, information
  and signal processing, intellectual property law, policy-making, as
  well as business analysis and economics.  Its purpose is to bring
  together researchers from the above fields for a full day of formal
  talks and informal discussions, covering new results that will spur
  new investigations regarding the foundations and practices of DRM.</p>

  <p>This year's workshop, the eighth in the series, continues this
  tradition.  As in the previous editions, it is sponsored by ACM
  SIGSAC and is held in conjunction with the ACM Conference in
  Computer and Communications Security (CCS).</p>
