<h1>FHE.org&nbsp;2022: Call for Presentations</h1>

<p>FHE.org&nbsp;2022 is the <i>1st Annual FHE.org Conference on Fully Homomorphic Encryption</i>. It is co-located with EUROCRYPT&nbsp;2022 and will be
  held in Trondheim (Norway) on May&nbsp;29, 2022.</p>

<h2>Motivation and scope</h2>
<p>First envisioned in the late seventies, the first realization for
fully homomorphic encryption only came three decades later. Fully
homomorphic encryption has since been an active research topic. The
FHE.org conference aims at being the premier forum gathering researchers,
technologists and practitioners working on the design, development,
deployment, validation, and applications of fully homomorphic
encryption.</p>
<p>The program committee is seeking original contributions on all aspects of
fully homomorphic encryption. Submissions across a broad range of the
development phases are encouraged, from exploratory research and
proof-of-concept studies to practical applications and deployment of
fully homomorphic encryption and related technologies. Topics of
interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fully homomorphic encryption and its applications</li>
  <li>Efficient and secure implementations of cryptographic algorithms</li>  
  <li>Software for fully homomorphic encryption</li>
  <li>Hardware architectures for fully homomorphic encryption</li>
  <li>Compilers for fully homomorphic encryption</li>
  <li>Physical attacks and countermeasures</li>    
  <li>Secure applications using fully homomorphic encryption</li>  
  <li>Security of encrypted computing and applications</li>
  <li>Cryptographic protocols for privacy-preserving systems</li>
  <li>Formal modeling and formal proofs for encrypted computing</li>
  <li>Validation and certification of fully homomorphic encryption</li>
</ul>

<h2>Call for contributed talks, posters, and demos</h2>
<p>Authors are invited to submit proposals for presentation (PDF format) using <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fheorg2022">the submission form</a>. Submissions must be written in English and should be in the form of an extended abstract of 2 to 4 pages (not including references). Authors can also submit proposals for posters or demos; this should be clearly indicated in the submission. All submissions will be refereed by the program committee. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the contribution.</p>

<p>The final program will consist of both invited talks and
contributed talks. It will also feature a poster session and
demos. There are no published proceedings at FHE.org. This means that
both invited and contributed talks may appear at another conference
that has proceedings. Authors of accepted abstracts can choose to have
a link to a preprint on the conference webpage.</p>
