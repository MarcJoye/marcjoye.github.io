<h1>FHE.org&nbsp;2022: Call for Presentations</h1>

<p>FHE.org&nbsp;2022 is the <i>1st International Conference on Fully Homomorphic Encryption</i>. It is co-located with EUROCRYPT&nbsp;2022 and will be
  held in Trondheim (Norway) on May&nbsp;29, 2022.</p>

<h2>Motivation and Scope</h2>
<p>First envisioned in the late seventies, the first realization for
fully homomorphic encryption only came three decades later. Fully
homomorphic encryption has since been an active research topic. The
FHE.org conference aims at being the premier forum gathering researchers,
technologists and practitioners working on the design, development,
deployment, validation and applications of fully homomorphic
encryption.</p>
<p>The program committee is seeking original papers on all aspects of
fully homomorphic encryption. Submissions across a broad range of the
development phases are encouraged, from exploratory research and
proof-of-concept studies to practical applications and deployment of
fully homomorphic encryption and related technologies. Topics of
interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fully homomorphic encryption and its applications</li>
  <li>Efficient and secure implementations of cryptographic algorithms</li>  
  <li>Software for fully homomorphic encryption</li>
  <li>Hardware architectures for fully homomorphic encryption</li>
  <li>Compilers for fully homomorphic encryption</li>
  <li>Physical attacks and countermeasures</li>    
  <li>Secure applications using fully homomorphic encryption</li>  
  <li>Security of encrypted computing and applications</li>
  <li>Cryptographic protocols for privacy-preserving systems</li>
  <li>Formal modeling and formal proofs for encrypted computing</li>
  <li>Validation and certification of fully homomorphic encryption and applications</li>
</ul>

<h2>Paper submission</h2>
<p>Authors are invited to submit papers (PDF format) with novel
contributions electronically using the submission form available on
the following web
site: <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fhe2022">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fhe2022</a>.
Submitted papers must be original, unpublished, <em>anonymous</em>,
and not submitted to journals or other conferences/workshops that have
proceedings. Submissions must be written in English and should be a
3-5 page abtract. All submissions will be blind-refereed.</p>

<p>Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to
register and present the paper. The proceedings will be published in
the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Accepted
papers should follow the LNCS default author instructions
  at <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>.
  LNCS LaTeX class file can be found <a href="https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19238648/data/v1">here</a>.</p>
