      <td>A non-interactive zero-knowledge proof permits the construction
	of a proof of the truth of a statement that reveals nothing else but the
	fact that the statement is true. Non-interactive
	zero-knowledge proofs are 
	used in the construction of numerous cryptographic schemes such as
	public-key cryptosystems and advanced digital signatures.
	
	The only practically efficient constructions of non-interactive
	zero-knowledge proofs that are based on standard
	intractability assumptions 
	come from pairing based-cryptography. In this talk, we sketch these
	constructions and show how pairing-based non-interactive zero-knowledge
	proofs smoothly integrate with other pairing-based
	cryptographic schemes.</td>

	<tr>
	  <th>Abstract:</th>
	  <td>There are many bilinear pairings that naturally appear when one
	    studies elliptic curves, abelian varieties, and related
	    groups.  Some of these pairings, notably the Weil and Tate
	    pairings, can be defined 
	    over finite fields and have important applications in cryptography.
	    Others, such as the Neron-Tate canonical height pairing and the
	    Cassel's pairing on the Shafarevich-Tate group, are of fundamental
	    importance in number theory and arithmetic geometry, but
	    have not yet seen significant use in cryptography. In this
	    talk I will present a 
	    survey of the many pairings that are used to study
	    elliptic curves and 
	    abelian varieties, and I will attempt to fit them into a wider
	    framework that illustrates their interrelationships.

	    Joseph Silverman received an Sc.B. from Brown University
	    in 1977 and a 
	    Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1982 under the direction of John
	    Tate. He then held positions at M.I.T. and Boston University before
	    moving to Brown University in 1988, where he is currently
	    a professor 
	    of mathematics.  Silverman works primarily in number theory,
	    arithmetic geometry, arithmetic dynamics and cryptography. He has
	    published more than 100 research articles in these areas, and has
	    written or coauthored seven books, including several on elliptic
	    curves and one on cryptography.  Two of his books on elliptic curves
	    were awarded the Steele Prize by the American Mathematical
	    Society in 1998.

	Pairing-Based Cryptography</em></td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Abstract:</th>
      <td>Over the last decade, pairing-based cryptography has found a
	wide range of interesting applications. It often yields the most
	elegant (if not the cheapest) techniques. This talk will
	overview two topics where pairing-based methods either have not
	been applied or have not yet achieved their potential. 
	The first topic is privacy-preserving set operations, such as private
	set intersection (PSI) protocols. Despite lots of prior work,
	state-of-the-art (in terms of efficiency) PSI is grounded in more
	mundane non-pairing based settings. This is puzzling, since the
	same does not hold with closely related secret handshakes and
	affiliation-hiding key exchange (AH-AKE) techniques. The second
	topic is more applied: security in unattended wireless sensor
	networks (UWSNs). We discuss certain unique security issues
	occurring in UWSNs, overview some protection measures, and
	consider whether pairing-based cryptography has some applications
	in this context.  
	Finally, we consider code attestation of embedded devices and, after
	discussing current approaches, once again, ask whether pairing
	techniques can be of use.</td>
