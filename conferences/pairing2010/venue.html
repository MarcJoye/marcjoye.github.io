 <h1>Special Attractions in banquet: "Yamanaka-bushi"</h1>

  <p>
  In the second evening dinner, you can enjoy eating and drinking Japanese food, 
  watching "Yamanaka-bushi" at Kajikaso Royal Hotel. Today Yamanaka-bushi is known 
  as one of the folk songs in hot-spring areas. A long time ago, it was a local folk 
  song popular in the adjacent rural area of Yamanaka Hot Spring. Somewhere down the line, 
  the folk song was often sung in banquets. Yamanaka-bushi is beautiful slow-tempo song 
  and you can feel relax in a hot-spring atmosphere.

  <h1>Special Attractions in banquet: "Noh" and "Kyogen"</h1>

  <p>You can enjoy eating and drinking Japanese food, watching "Noh" and
  "Kyogen" at Yamanaka-za by Kinjoh-Nohgakukai. 
  Noh and Kyogen are one category of "Nogaku", which is one of the
  traditional Japanese theatrical arts. 
  The Japanese Government designated Nogaku as an Important Intangible
  Cultural Property in 1957.  
  Nogaku was designated by UNESCO as World Intangible Cultural
  Heritage in 2001.</p>

	It developed alongside noh, was performed along with noh as
	an intermission of sorts between noh acts,  
	and retains close links to noh in the modern day; therefore,
	it is sometimes designated noh-kyogen. 
	However, its content is not at all similar to the formal,
	symbolic, and solemn noh theater;  
	kyogen is a comical form, and its primary goal is to make its
	audience laugh.

  <h2>Program&nbsp;1: Noh</h2>
  <h3>Title: HAGOROMO (= THE ROBE OF FEATHERS)</h3>

  <p>Story:<br /> In a spring morning, a fisherman called "Hakuryu"
 (=&nbsp;White Dragon) found a beautiful robe hanging from the branch
 of a pine tree. He tried to bring home the robe as family
 treasure. Then a goddess appeared before him, and asked him to return
 it. He did not listen to her at first. She was so sad, and explained
 that she was unable to ascend again to Heaven without the robe. He
 was so moved by her distress that he agreed to return it if she would
 dance for him. <br /> The goddess wearing the robe danced presenting
 the Moon Place, and maintained a lot of dance. At last she soared to
 the faraway Mt. Fuji, and disappeared up to Heaven among the mists
 and clouds.<br /> This story is one of the most popular works of
 Noh. This is very crisp and beautiful story because the goddess
 dances turning her robe in a spring scene.</p>

  <h2>Program&nbsp;2: Kyogen</h2> <h3>Title: BUSU (= POISON)</h3>
  <p>Story:<br /> The comical characters Taro-kaja and Jiro-kaja
  stayed at home in their master's absence. Before their master left,
  he said "There is a poison known as busu in the tab. Don't get too
  close to that." In his absence, they had a great interest in the
  busu. At last, Taro-kaja looked the content of the tub. It looked
  delicious!! Taro-kaja ate it, and noticed that it was Japanese
  liquid candy. They noticed that their master told a lie! They
  consumed the liquid candy with zeal.<br /> Next, they made up a
  story to explain. They then deliberately broke a household treasure
  belonging to their master. When he returned, they cried and
  explained that they ate the busu intending to die in order to
  expiate what they have done, but they could not die and felt so
  sad. Their master had a lost face.</p>
